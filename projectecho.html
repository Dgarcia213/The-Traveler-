	<p>
		
The Project Echo 
was founded by the remaining leaders of Planet Neptune. They formed this plan in order to help their people survive their dying planet. They started by accepting volunteers and training them for the task. Through this they were able to select their travelers that would best suit the mission. The travelers are then called by the number they were assigned and through this they keep track of how many travelers they have sent into the void of space. The travelers have been warned of the dangers that await them out there and have been supplied with tools to help them on their travels. Once an Echo finds a suitable planet for their people, they must contact headquarters and await further instructions.
